**PYTHON-PROJECTS**

**MAGICAL CALCULATOR**

A Unique calculator using basic functions.

Created by : Rohini Koli 
Project Topic : Magical Calculator

The basic operations of a calculator are covered in this project but something additional is also added.
The features will be highlighted with the working of the calculator as explained below:

1. Take an equation as an input from the user.
2. The result is obtained and this result is stored in a variable for performing further operations on it.
3. Everytime when a given equation is solved , the output is stored and further equations are accepted and calculated continuously with the previous one.
4. It goes on until an unless the user gives the quit command to the calculator.
5. The catchy feature of this calculator is it accepts multiple equations and each equation can contain multiple operators (operators consists of +,-,*,/,% for basic calculations)  
6. And also if a user passes strings,letters,words or anything that can't be counted in an equation, the calculator automatically ignores those unwanted characters and returns an appropriate result.

I developed this project using python because python has many inbuilt functions that reduce number of lines in a code and is also easy to read,write and understand.
I hope this README file must have explained everything about how this 'MAGICAL CALCULATOR' functions.
